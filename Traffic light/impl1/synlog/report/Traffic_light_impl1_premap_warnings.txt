@W: MT529 :"d:\semister 2\digital system deesign\lab\traffic light roject work\29-1-2018\main.v":18:0:18:5|Found inferred clock TrafficLight|CLK which controls 53 sequential elements including state[16:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
